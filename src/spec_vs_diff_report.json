The YES flow is updated to show a final-stage image at /assets/aman_suz_pic.jpeg, but the actual static asset file is not added in this diff, so the requirement to include and reliably serve the provided image is not fully met.",

      "reason": "The code references /assets/aman_suz_pic.jpeg, but the diff shows no added files, so the image itself is not included in the repository as a static asset in this change set.",

      "reason": "The YES->celebrating->final transition is implemented and the final stage references /assets/aman_suz_pic.jpeg, but because the image file is not added anywhere in this diff, the acceptance criterion that it renders reliably on refresh as a static asset is not satisfied by the changes shown.",
